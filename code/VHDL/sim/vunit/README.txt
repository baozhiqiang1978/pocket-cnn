 
each tb consists of 4 processes:
 - main: loads data and starts test
 - clk
 - stimuli: transfer stimuli to dut
 - data_check: get results from dut and compare with reference data

the input and reference data gets generated by the python script run.py

to run multiple tb, simply run run_all.py -p4

TODO:
 - add more tb
 - verify timings, not only data -> for buffer
